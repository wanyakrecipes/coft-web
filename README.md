Source code for [councilsofthefuture.org](https://www.councilsofthefuture.org/), based on [esculate/hugo-split-theme](https://github.com/escalate/hugo-split-theme).

The underlying tech of this website uses the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## TODO
- split.css - work on font sizing and thickness across all tags to ensure effective UX.
- images - need to work on image re-sizing, so it scales to fit half a page.
- list.html - separate date and title classes, so former doesn't get underlined. see ewen.io for inspiration.
- footer.html - adjust lyrics and music so they're more prominent.
- posts/list.html - add tags to the bottom of the article.
- posts/single.html - add image and caption to head of the article before content
