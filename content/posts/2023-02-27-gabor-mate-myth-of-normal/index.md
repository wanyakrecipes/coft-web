I have lived on the edge of my nerves. Perhaps I still do. The question that I have started to ask myself is: *why*? 

[Dr. Gabor Maté](https://drgabormate.com/about/), a world-renowned expert in areas such as addiction and trauma, had plenty of suggestions as to why.

His latest book, [*The Myth of Normal*](https://drgabormate.com/book/the-myth-of-normal/), provides compelling evidence that our environment produces a society riddled with mental illness, among other chronic conditions. 

This made me pause and reflect on my own environment - London - and write down things in my sphere that cause me daily stress:

* Bombardment of adverts, seemingly filling every square inch and pixel. When I look up from my seat on the train, I want to see nothing. My attention is not wanting to be grabbed.
* As a mixed-race White and Black African, the background hum of suspicion and discrimination continually grates and erodes my soul.
* I'm perturbed by the level of uniformity when I walk across London Bridge. I wonder to myself that it can't be true that everyone's authentic self produces the same wardrobe.

Perhaps that's why I can feel my nerves. <!--These days I am feeling better but when they are touched, they still feel tender.-->

I was introduced to the wondrous, warm and gentle words of Dr. Maté by my GP when I was, and still struggle with, anxiety and depression.

I *uber* resonated with [*When the Body Says No*](https://drgabormate.com/book/when-the-body-says-no/), specifically the idea that stress leaves its mark. That led me to start an inquiry of Mark - *what trauma has left a mark on you?*

*The Myth of Normal* has moved me to unexpected places that were previously unseen and hazy to me. These places are where I can gather and converse with, as Dr. Maté defines it, my *stubborn friends* [^1]. 

[^1]: (pg.431) Dr. Maté uses the term *stupid friends*, but offers the alternatives *obtuse* and *stubborn*. I prefer the latter.] 

Stubborn friends are our inner demons - guilt, self-loathing, shame to name a few - that persist long after they entered into our lives. They once had a purpose to help sooth our pain, but they impede our ability to heal.  

As Dr. Maté describes it, an essential part of the healing process is when we start to acknowledge these torments, however difficult they may be to explore. When I first encountered my nerves, they were often tense and oddly excitable. But after exploring them, they are often relaxed and at ease.

<!-- I have found that the contours of my pain are often hard, but exploring them with compassion has helped to soften their corners. -->



<!-- But things change, and so does the way we speak to and understand our inner torments.-->

Dr. Maté has provided me with vocabulary and the nous to explore my experiences in a compassionate way. 

I would recommend you explore Gabor - you never know what you might find out about yourself.


<!--I'm pertubed by how much I stand out when crossing London Bridge. I'm not wearing blue and grey. The lack of authenticty scares me.-->

something about

In other words, I have started a *compassionate inquiry* into the I had neglected. 

I had neglected them because not only did I ignore them, I lacked the vocabulary, compassion and time to do so. Th 

His writing has moved me to unexpected places, a frontier where I can see a little better, less prone to haze. A place where I can meet, as Gabor Mate terms it, my *stubborn friends*.

<!-- something about Future Shock and living in an accelorated society 

Gabor Mate isn't the first to recognise society's ills. Alvin Toffler's Future SHock suggested that a transcient and acccelarated society cause xyz issues.

Circling back to 

I also resonate with the Gabor's hypothesis that our society and environment shapes who you are. After pondering this, I thought what things in my current environment of London I find difficult to handle on daily basis:

* The bombardment of adverts, seemingly filling every square inch and pixel. When I look up from my seat on the train, I really just want to see nothing. My attention is not wanting to be grabbed.
* As mixed-race white and black African, the background hum of suspicion and discrimination continually grates and erodes my soul.
* I'm perturbed by the uniformity when I walk across London Bridge. I wonder to myself that it can't be true that everyone's authentic self produces the same wardrobe.
