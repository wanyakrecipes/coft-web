## TODO
- split.css - work on font sizing and thickness across all tags to ensure effective UX.
- images - need to work on image re-sizing, so it scales to fit half a page.
- posts/list.html:

  * separate date and title classes, so former doesn't get underlined. see ewen.io for inspiration. also may need a separate css style.
  * add tags to the bottom of the article.
- footer.html - adjust lyrics and music so they're more prominent.
- posts/list.html - 
- split.css - make font for bio slightly smaller.
- posts/single.html: create params for sub title and image rendering.
