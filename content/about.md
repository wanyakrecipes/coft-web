Mark Wanzala-Ryan is a multi-instrumentalist who produces music under the stage name *Councils of the Future*. 

Councils of the Future creates minimal ambient soundscapes inspired by Hiroshi Yoshimura and Aphex Twin, generating places where Mark Hollis, Burial and the Bebop crew could converse. He also writes about music, philosophy and mental health. He currently resides in South London.

Coined by Alvin Toffler in [Future Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock), Councils of the Future are "teams of men and women devoted to probing the future in the interest of the present" (pg. 404).
