Creating colourful and dissociated dream-like compositions that makes observations on modern living, the music provides shelter where Vangelis and Mark Hollis could converse, or Burial could provide an alternative soundtrack for members of the Bebop. <br>

Coined by Alvin Toffler in [Future Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock), Councils of the Future are "teams of men and women devoted to probing the future in the interest of the present" (pg. 404). <br>
