I'm delighted to present [Pleased to Meet You EP](https://councilsofthefuture.bandcamp.com/album/pleased-to-meet-you-ep), a slice of minimal ambient music inspired by Hiroshi Yoshimura with a hint of *Selected Ambient Works* era Aphex Twin. 

It was written in moments of winter solitude whilst watching amateur golfers from my window.

Special thanks to [Rand Ghibril](https://www.instagram.com/i_think_therefore_i_overthink/) for the delightful sketch, and to Alex Hollingsworth at [Octagon London Studios](https://www.octagonlondon.com/) in Brixton for adding warmth.

Iâ€™d like to thank all the gardeners who helped water me - you know who you are.
