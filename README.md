## TODO
- Create "musings", which contains blog posts stored in content/posts. Will need to use HTML partials from other blog website.
- In footer.html, add homepage as a permanent link.
- Create a footer.html for musing posts which have a link back to "musings" or the "home page".
- Update font to Exo2, to be consistent with logo on soundcloud and bandcamp.
- Alter the colour of text, line 125 of split.css
- Need to work on image re-sizing, so it scales to fit half a page.
