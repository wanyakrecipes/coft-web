<!--Could make the about me both about me workwise, and my passions and hobbies.-->

This website contains a colllection of my thoughts and musings on AI, music and philosophy. As an avid musician, it contains links to my creative works and influences.

<!-- Councils of the Future creates minimal ambient soundscapes inspired by Hiroshi Yoshimura and Aphex Twin, generating places where Mark Hollis, Burial and the Bebop crew could converse. He also writes about music, philosophy and mental health. He currently resides in South London. -->

Coined by Alvin Toffler in [Future Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock), Councils of the Future are "teams of men and women devoted to probing the future in the interest of the present" (pg. 404). 

Take a look around - maybe something will resonate with you too.
