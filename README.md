Source code for [councilsofthefuture.org](https://www.councilsofthefuture.org/), based on [esculate/hugo-split-theme](https://github.com/escalate/hugo-split-theme).

The underlying tech of this website uses the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## TODO
- Create "musings", which contains blog posts stored in content/posts. Will need to use HTML partials from other blog website.
- Create a footer.html for musing posts which have a link back to "musings" or the "home page".
- Update font to Exo2, to be consistent with logo on soundcloud and bandcamp.
- Alter the colour of text, line 125 of split.css
- Need to work on image re-sizing, so it scales to fit half a page.
- Need to add clean links to each section (so /about, not /about.html)
- Alter footer.html so that home and gitbug have slightly larger font to credit.
- Need to layouts/posts list.html and single.html to enable content/posts to generate automatically.
